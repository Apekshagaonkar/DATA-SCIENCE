## Project: Forecasting Stock Market Prices

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Forecasting_Stock_Market_Prices.ipynb` notebook file.
You will also be required to use the included  Python file and the dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs) file to complete your work.
While some code has already been implemented to get you started, 
you will need to implement additional functionality in order to successfully complete the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Forecasting_Stock_Market_Prices/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:


ipython notebook Forecasting_Stock_Market_Prices.ipynb

or

jupyter notebook Forecasting_Stock_Market_Prices.ipynb


This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
